Submission 2 for Unity jr programmer pathway

Create a project with the 4 pillars of OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation & Abstraction)

For this project, I chose to make a top-down shooter in which you control a spitfire that must deal with several types of UFOs.

1/ Player and enemy UFOs all inherit from ShipParent.cs //INHERITANCE - OK!

2/ There are 3 Types of enemies (small, medium, big) with different characteristics //POLYMORPHISM - OK!

3/ No more public variables in code (except a few that are protected with getters and setters) //ENCAPSULATION - Almost done!

4/ Most of the code is separated in different functions and is easy to read //ABSTRACTION - Almost done!

To DO:
    -Add Music and Sound FX


Looks good enough, now clean your code!
