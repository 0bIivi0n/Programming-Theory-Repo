Submission 2 for Unity jr programmer pathway

Create a project with the 4 pillars of OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation & Abstraction)

For this project, I chose to make a top-down shooter in which you control a spitfire that must deal with several types of UFOs.

1/ Player and enemy UFOs all inherits from ShipParent.cs //INHERITANCE
2/ There are 3 Types of enemies (small, medium, big) with different characteristics //POLYMORPHISM
3/ No more public variables in code (except a few that are protected with getters and setters) //ENCAPSULATION
4/ Most of the code is separated in different functions and is easy to read //ABSTRACTION

All of this is OK.
Now I just want to add a few extra features to make it fun to play, even though it's just an exercice. 

-Powerups: Like faster fire or a shockwave that deal damage to all enemies.
-Difficulty adjustments.
-Details: moving background and stuff.
