Submission 2 for Unity jr programmer pathway

Create a project with the 4 pillars of OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation & Abstraction)

For this project, I chose to make a top-down shooter in which you control a spitfire that must deal with several types of UFOs.

1/ Player and enemy UFOs all inherit from ShipParent.cs //INHERITANCE

2/ There are 3 Types of enemies (small, medium, big) with different characteristics //POLYMORPHISM

3/ No more public variables in code (except a few that are protected with getters and setters) //ENCAPSULATION
NOT TRUE ANYMORE !!! New public variables added with last features, must see to it.

4/ Most of the code is separated in different functions and is easy to read //ABSTRACTION


All of this is OK (I guess).
Now I just want to add a few extra features to make it fun to play, even though it's just an exercice. 

-Powerups: Faster fire or shockwave that deal damage to all enemies.

-Boss Battles
