Submission 2 for Unity jr programmer pathway

Create a project with the 4 pillars of OOP (Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation & Abstraction)

For this project, I chose to make a top-down shooter in which you control a spitfire that must deal with several types of UFOs.

1/ Player and enemy UFOs all inherit from ShipParent.cs //INHERITANCE - OK!

2/ There are 3 Types of enemies (small, medium, big) with different characteristics //POLYMORPHISM - OK!

3/ Almost all variables and functions are private or protected. //ENCAPSULATION - OK!

4/ Most of the code is separated in different functions and is easy to read //ABSTRACTION - OK!


Looks good enough, now clean your code!
